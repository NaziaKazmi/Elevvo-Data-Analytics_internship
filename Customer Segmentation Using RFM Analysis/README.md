 Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis  
  
It focuses on applying **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** to the **Online Retail Dataset (UCI)** in order to segment customers and suggest marketing strategies.  

 ## Project Overview  
- **Recency** â†’ How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency** â†’ How often a customer makes purchases  
- **Monetary** â†’ How much money a customer spends  

Using these metrics, customers are scored and grouped into segments such as:  
- Champions  
- Loyal Customers  
- Potential Loyalists  
- At Risk / Inactive  

 ## Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  
   
  ## Results & Insights  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Customer segment distribution (bar chart)  
  - RFM heatmap (Recency vs Frequency, avg Monetary)  
- **Customer Analytics**:  
  - Segment-level averages for Recency, Frequency, Monetary  
- **Marketing Suggestions**:

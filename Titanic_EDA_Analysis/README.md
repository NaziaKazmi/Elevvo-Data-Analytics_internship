Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is part of the Elevvo Data Analysis Internship. The goal was to explore and analyze the classic Titanic dataset using Python and generate insights using data visualization techniques.

Objectives:
- Handle missing data and clean the dataset
- Convert data types where necessary
- Generate summary statistics
- Perform group-based analysis (e.g., survival by gender, class)
- Visualize key insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Key Insights:
- Higher survival rate among females
- First-class passengers had better survival chances
- Children had better survival rates than older adults

Tools & Libraries:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Seaborn**
- **Matplotlib**

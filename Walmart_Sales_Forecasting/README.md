Walmart Sales Forecasting Task

The main objective was to analyze Walmart's sales dataset, visualize sales trends, and forecast future sales using **Exponential Smoothing**.

## Project Overview
- Preprocessed Walmart sales data into monthly format.
- Visualized sales trends with line plots and heatmaps.
- Built a forecasting model with Exponential Smoothing.
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels (Exponential Smoothing)

## Results
- Sales trends were successfully visualized across different months and years.
- The Exponential Smoothing model was applied for forecasting future sales.
- MAPE score was used to evaluate forecast accuracy.

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Walmart_Sales_Forecasting.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook to see the data analysis, visualizations, and forecasting results.
